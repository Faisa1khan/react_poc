## Hls docs

Hls.DefaultConfig that is autogenrated at the time of new intance created but we can always change it accordingly by passing a config object to the new instance or by changing the config hls.config.['property_to_change'].

eg. hls.config.debug = true; // Setting config.debug = true; will turn on debug logs on JS console.
